mersad.classical.affine_cipher module.
======================================

The affine is a type of mono alphabetical substitution
cipher, wherein each letter in an alphabet is mapped to
its numeric equivalent, encrypted using a single mathematical
function, and converted back to a letter.

class AffineCipher(MersadClassicalBase):
    r"""
    Affine cipher algorithm class.

    Create an instance like every other python class.

    Example:
    ==================================

    >>> agent = AffineCipher(key=235, letter_sequence="abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz")
    >>> # encrypt a string
    >>> agent.encrypt("Is this really more secure than shift cipher?")
    'Ih qmvh ylbwwj fxyl hltzyl qmbo hmvuq tvgmly?'

    ==================================

    AffineCipher takes keyword arguments when initializing new instance.

    Valid kwargs keys are listed in below:
        - key             : (optional) primary key.
        - letter_sequence : (optional) alphabet for using in cipher.
        - shuffle         : (optional) randomize letter sequence order.
        - seed            : (optional)(requires shuffle) specifies a seed
                            for randomizing, default seed is 0.

    Agent uses predefined default values for each of above arguments if
    it isn't provided by the user, for above example the key and letter sequence
    are provided by user but not shuffle and seed, agent will use default values
    for shuffle and seed.

    Default key is set to 0.
    Default letter sequence is set to "string.printable" except "\r".
    Default shuffle is set to False.
    Default seed is set to 0.

    Each instance has it's own unique configurations saved in
    self.configuration and can work independent from other instances.

    Configurations can be changed even after initialization via
    self.config() method.

    Example:
    ==================================

    >>> # create object without any keyword arguments so agent will use
    >>> # default values for all the settings.
    >>> agent = AffineCipher()
    >>> # override defaults.
    >>> agent.config(key=135)
    >>> # encrypt a string
    >>> agent.encrypt("Is this really more secure than shift cipher?")
    '<"t#QR"t!NJUU(tVX!Nt"NL$!Nt#QJWt"QRO#tLRYQN!h'
